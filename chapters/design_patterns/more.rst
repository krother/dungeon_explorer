The Composite Pattern
=====================

Implement a monster consisting of multiple `Monster` objects that occupy multiple tiles in the dungeon
(e.g. a dragon or giant snake).
Use the `Composite Pattern <https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/composite>`__.

----

The State Pattern
=================

Implement a `GamePaused` class that has the same interface as the `DungeonGame`.
The UI should have a `state` attribute that is an instance of either class.

Add a pause key that changes the state from the running game to the paused state and back.

----

The Adapter Pattern
===================

Write a custom monster that has a different interface than the monsters you already have.
Implement an adapter class that wraps the monster but inherits from your usual Monster class.

Also, write a mapper function that converts the attributes of one class to another.

----

The Builder Pattern
===================

The `Builder Pattern <https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/builder>`__ is very common. We will probably find an example for the Builder pattern soon.

Discuss pros and cons of distributing the movement of player and monsters to seaparate threads or `async` functions.
