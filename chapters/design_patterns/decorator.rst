The Decorator Pattern
=====================

Log the moves of the player in a file using a decorator.
The original `Decorator pattern <https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/decorator>`__ can be considered obsolete, but the main idea is useful.
Check the following sources to learn how decorators work:

- `a decorator function <https://www.academis.eu/advanced_python/functions/decorators.html>`__
- `a decorator class <https://www.academis.eu/advanced_python/classes/decorator_class.html>`__
- `the Python logging module <https://www.academis.eu/advanced_python/functions/decorators.html>`__

.. hint::

    Can you also log the moves of the monsters using the same decorator?

.. hint::

    Add other attributes and methods to the `MonsterManager` as you deem necessary.
