Pixels on the Screen
====================

Calculate the number of pixels in your game by writing Python code:

1. store the number 32 in a variable `tile_size`
2. calculate how many pixels a 10 x 12 dungeon is wide and high if every tile has the extent `tile_size`.
3. store the result in two variables `win_x` and `win_y`.
4. calculate the product of the two variables (the number of pixels on the screen).
5. print the result.
